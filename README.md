# RAG-LLM

This repository contains code for implementing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with LLMs (GPT-3 & GPT-4) using an agent based approach. We perform RAG using 2 kinds of databases: a tabular RDBMS (Postgres) and a graph database (Neo4j). We use Langchain for interacting with the LLM agents.
